# coding-rules-and-regulations-for-java
Explaining and exemplifying Java programming rules and regulations from the [SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for java](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/SEI+CERT+Oracle+Coding+Standard+for+Java).

## Description
Each group member was tasked with researching several rules and recommendations. We provide an example of each rule and recommendation we researched in it's own Java file.

Additionally, we combined several of these rules and recommendations in to one large program.

## Rules
The list rules and recommendations we researched is as follows:

**Rules**
- Rule 00. Input Validation and Data Sanitization (IDS)
  - IDS01-J. Normalize strings before validating them
  - IDS03-J. Do not log unsanitized user input
- Rule 02. Expressions (EXP)
  - EXP00-J. Do not ignore values returned by methods
  - EXP02-J. Do not use the Object.equals() method to compare two arrays
- Rule 05. Object Orientation (OBJ)
  - OBJ01-J. Limit accessibility of fields
  - OBJ07-J. Sensitive classes must not let themselves be copied
  - OBJ09-J. Compare classes and not class names
  - OBJ13-J. Ensure that references to mutable objects are not exposed
- Rule 06. Methods
- Rule 07. Exceptional Behavior
- Rule 13. Input Output

**Recommendations**
